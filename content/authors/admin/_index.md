I am a PhD student in Marine Biology at the University of Southampton, working within the [Rius Lab Group](http://riuslab.com/).

My current research looks at the role of hybridisation and climate change in the redistribution of marine biodiversity. Using a group of marine invertebrates called ascidians, I investigate the mechanisms that alter species ranges, and try to understand the ecological and evolutionary consequences of range shifts.
