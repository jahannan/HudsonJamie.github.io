abstract: "Genomic approaches are increasingly being used to study biological
invasions. Here, we first analyse how high-throughput sequencing has aided our
understanding of the mechanisms associated with biological invasions. These
include the transport of propagules to pre-invaded areas, an exploration of the
consequences of hybridisation during range expansions, and the pre- and postinvasion adaptation of colonising populations. We then explore how contemporary
genomic methods have been used to probe and monitor the spread of non-indigenous
species. More specifically, we focus on the detection of species richness from
environmental samples, measures of quantitative traits that may promote invasiveness, analysis of rapid adaptation, and the study of phenotypic plasticity. Finally, we
look to the future, exploring how genomic approaches will assist future biodiversity
conservationists in their efforts to mitigate the spread and effects of biological
invasions. Ultimately, although the use of genomic tools to study non-indigenous
species has so far been rather limited, studies to date indicate that genomic tools offer
unparalleled research opportunities to continually improve our understanding of
marine biological invasions."
